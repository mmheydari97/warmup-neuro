This repository contains some machine learning solution implemented with
neurolab in python.

### Table of contents
| | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | 
|1| **[Perceptron Classifier](perceptron_classifier.py)** | Building a perceptron based classifier, Training it and checking its success rate.
|2| **[Single Layer Neural Network](simple_neural_network.py)** | Build a single layer neural network to predict based on a 4 class dataset with 2 features. 
|3| **[Multilayer Neural Network](multilayer_neural_network.py)** | Giving more freedom to our model by adding layers. Extract underlying patterns. Using it as a regressor.
